# TODO

## 🔄 In Progress

    ## High Priority 🔥
    - [ ] Implement test script with ANALYTICAL solution for validation
    - [ ] Clarify source_term units ! maybe add an explanation -- it'll be indirectly done through analytical validations
    - [ ] adaptative timestep

    ## Medium Priority ⚡
    - [ ] Hybrid display on results, plot water table / rain mm / salt flux (maybe just tweak the source_term plot)

    ## Side-side project that will never see the light
    - [ ] Use pyTorch and code a optimization loop to auto-fit parameters ! (probably doable for richard's)
    - [ ] TRY some uncertainty evaluation with bayesian simulation using PYRO ????
    - [ ] Track processing time to evaluate what takes time, and ...

    ## ULTRA Low Priority 💡
    - [ ] Improve functionSpace and boundary conditions declaration logic
    - [ ] Code cleanup
    - [ ] Documentation
    - [ ] Import curves from txt/csv

## ✅ Completed
- [x] Fit RAF curves to use fast vg params instead
- [x] D0 problem OR just values too low and mass loss - seems to be working !
- [x] Add processing duration in config and add it to the report
- [x] Save pdf instead of png, with all parameters
- [x] Improve from_library logic, overal material params, maybe centralize the library - MAKE IT READABLE
- [x] Improve plotters logic, it sucks
- [x] Major update of physics/field_maping interaction
- [x] Correct Result plotter : as is can't not plot measured and comsol ...
- [x] Update ProbeManager and snapshotManager to be more versatile to compute 
    chloride concentration or conductivity for example
- [x] Improve physics architecture, i.e. better separation between domain, materials and equations
- [x] Implement Hampel filtering for measured data, resave the csv after
- [x] Implement building rain_scenarios from meteostat (will it match measured data better ?)
        -> YES KINDA WORK BETTER, NEED TO FIND THE PROPER STATION I THINK
- [x] Clean former rain_scenario
- [x] REPAIR THE CODE : IT WAS THE CHANGE IN SMOOTHING PARAMETER IN MATERiAL.FROM_CURVES
- [x] Fix datetime implementation
- [x] Build a functioning generic source_term instead of former rain_scenario
- [x] Initial setup
- [x] Basic structure


## 🚀 Future Ideas
- [ ] Add advanced features
- [ ] Performance optimization
