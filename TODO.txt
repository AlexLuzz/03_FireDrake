# TODO

## ðŸ”„ In Progress

    ## High Priority ðŸ”¥
    - [ ] Improve physics architecture, i.e. better separation between 
    - [ ] 
    - [ ] 

    ## Medium Priority âš¡
    - [ ] Better implementation of equation setup and solving, i.e. richards solver and building 
      should be separated
    - [ ] Implement building rain_scenarios from meteostat (will it match measured data better ?)
    - [ ] Implement Hampel filtering for measured data, resave the csv after
    - [ ] Implement test script with ANALYTICAL solution for validation

    ## Low Priority ðŸ’¡
    - [ ] Code cleanup
    - [ ] Documentation


## âœ… Completed
- [x] Clean former rain_scenario
- [x] REPAIR THE CODE : IT WAS THE CHANGE IN SMOOTHING PARAMETER IN MATERiAL.FROM_CURVES
- [x] Fix datetime implementation
- [x] Build a functioning generic source_term instead of former rain_scenario
- [x] Initial setup
- [x] Basic structure


## ðŸš€ Future Ideas
- [ ] Add advanced features
- [ ] Performance optimization
