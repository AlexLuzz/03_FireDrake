# TODO

## ðŸ”„ In Progress

    ## High Priority ðŸ”¥
    - [ ] complete the helper to define chloride source

    ## Medium Priority âš¡
    - [ ] Improve from_library logic, maybe centralize the library
    - [ ] Implement test script with ANALYTICAL solution for validation

    ## Low Priority ðŸ’¡
    - [ ] Code cleanup
    - [ ] Documentation


## âœ… Completed
- [x] Correct Result plotter : as is can't not plot measured and comsol ...
- [x] Update ProbeManager and snapshotManager to be more versatile to compute 
    chloride concentration or conductivity for example
- [x] Improve physics architecture, i.e. better separation between domain, materials and equations
- [x] Implement Hampel filtering for measured data, resave the csv after
- [x] Implement building rain_scenarios from meteostat (will it match measured data better ?)
        -> YES KINDA WORK BETTER, NEED TO FIND THE PROPER STATION I THINK
- [x] Clean former rain_scenario
- [x] REPAIR THE CODE : IT WAS THE CHANGE IN SMOOTHING PARAMETER IN MATERiAL.FROM_CURVES
- [x] Fix datetime implementation
- [x] Build a functioning generic source_term instead of former rain_scenario
- [x] Initial setup
- [x] Basic structure


## ðŸš€ Future Ideas
- [ ] Add advanced features
- [ ] Performance optimization
